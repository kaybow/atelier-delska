    <h3>about the atelier</h3>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-2-3 l-2-3">
        <p>It was a love of people—their history, language and culture that originally drew me to the study of fashion history during my time at Mount Allison University. As I continued my studies in fashion and costume design abroad in Sydney Australia, I fell in love with the care and craftsmanship that went into the garments of days gone by.<br>
        <br>I felt there was much that was lost in our modern age of fast fashion—garments often made cheaply and quickly and created with the intention of ending up in a trash pile by the following season. I was sad to see an infinite variety of beautiful body types squeezed into S-M-L labels and longed for a more careful and compassionate alternative.<br>
        <br>Atelier Delska was born with the intention of bringing the world of slow fashion back to live with designs inspired by the past. Each garment I craft is fitted and designed with care to be unique to you.<br>
        <br>My hope is that each garment we create together will remain a wardrobe favourite for years to come!</p>

    <h3>working together</h3>

    <div class="grid steps">
      <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-2-3 l-2-3">
        <h5>design vision and consultation</h5>
        <p>After an initial consultation in which we discuss your vision, I will produce one or more sketches of possible designs to choose from. These sketches may be modified until the final design is agreed upon.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-2-3 l-2-3">
        <h5>custom pattern creation</h5>
        <p>While an in-person fitting session for taking measurements is recommend, if not possible, a garment will be made based on the measurements provided. I will then draft a fitted personalized pattern that is customized for your garment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-2-3 l-2-3">
        <h5>garment construction and revisions</h5>
        <p>Typically, I will then fit a mock-up of your garment before constructing the commissioned piece in your desired fabric. Plenty of updates will be sent as you see your design come to life.<br>
        <br>We will continue to work together on the final garment until the desired fit is achieved and you have a design you absolutely LOVE!</p>

    <p><b>All orders require a non-refundable deposit of 50% before the start of work. You may also provide the materials directly in person, or place an online order to be shipped to my workspace.<br>
    <br>Final payment is due prior to delivery of the garment at the last fitting. Please allow a minimum of one month for any commissioned project to be completed.<br>
    <br><i>*If you have allergies to cats or dogs we may not be the best fit, as my studio is attached to a home with pets.</i></b></p>
