    <div class="unit xs-1 s-1-2 m-2-3 l-2-3">
      <p>It was a love of people—their history, language and culture that originally drew me to the study of fashion history during my time at Mount Allison University. As I continued my studies in fashion and costume design abroad in Sydney Australia, I fell in love with the care and craftsmanship that went into the garments of days gone by.<br>
      <br>I felt there was much that was lost in our modern age of fast fashion—garments often made cheaply and quickly and created with the intention of ending up in a trash pile by the following season. I was sad to see an infinite variety of beautiful body types squeezed into S-M-L labels and longed for a more careful and compassionate alternative.<br>
      <br>Atelier Delska was born with the intention of bringing the world of slow fashion back to live with designs inspired by the past. Each garment I craft is fitted and designed with care to be unique to you.<br>
      <br>My hope is that each garment we create together will remain a wardrobe favourite for years to come!</p>
